Extract from itch.io website:

*I mean if you are this desperate to play naughts and crosses just grab any old person off the street. To play simply read the book/PDF as if it were a pick your own adventure book. To place you move on any valid square turn to page number written on the square. The book will automatically make a move in response and you will be one move closer to losing (or tying).*


*Note: It may seem like the first two pages are incorrectly labeled. This is because originally this project was a guide  to help me cheat when playing tick tack toe with my friends, the joke being how massively impractical it would be to use, just to win a game of tick tack toe.*
