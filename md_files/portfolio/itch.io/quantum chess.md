To play this game download the exe. Navigate to the folder with the exe in it and open the command prompt. To make a move click the destination square. All the pieces that can move there will be moved at the same time. If only one piece can move to the destination square the the piece will as a normal chess piece. If more than one piece moves to the same square this will put that square into superposition. Pieces can move through squares that are in superposition as if the square was empty. The square will have a percentage of all of the pieces that tried to move to it. You can chose to observe any square instead of taking your turn. This will cause the square to collapse into a single state. The probabilities of each state is based on the percentage of each piece occupying the square. The game is won by capturing the opponents King. This replaces checkmate because the quantum nature of the pieces, and the random chances involved makes checkmate hard to define.
