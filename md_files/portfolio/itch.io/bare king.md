turn based, chess themed, rougelike, survival game

you play as the king on a 16x16 grid. White chess pieces appear on the edges of the board. Each third move you make the white pieces make a single move. The game ends when one of the white pieces successfully takes your king. 
You can equip 5 different abilities. The abilities cost energy to use. You can gain energy by taking other pieces. 

You get points relative to the value of the pieces that you take. If you take more than one piece at a time (using an ability) you get a point multiplier. As the game progresses the number, and difficulty of the enemy pieces increases.
