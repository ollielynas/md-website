The goal of this software is to replace the expensive ToF machines used for jugging trampolining routines with free software that can allow you to calculate your ToF using a video on your phone. This video analyses feature is currently the most complete feature of the software.

The program also has the ability to calculate the difficulty score of any individual skill based on FIG notation. The program can also be used to generate FIG notation for any skill. These skill can be combined into a routene and the difficulty of a routine will be automatically calculated. 

The project uses ffmpeg for video processing. ffmpeg is automatically downloaded with the app if you do not already have it.
