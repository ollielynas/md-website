Inspired by [The Password Game](https://neal.fun/password-game/). 
This game has room for improvement. Specifically the rules; being a mutable of x, and not including the numbers [a, b, c].

there is also a [firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/olynas-number-game-solver/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) that can solve the game in milliseconds.
