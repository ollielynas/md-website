Inspired by [The World's Hardest Game](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-worlds-hardest-game). This game contains a near infinite number of randomly generated and 100% possible movement based levels. To navigate the main menu use the tab button, and to start use the enter key. Some seeds have unique effects, e.g. "speed".
